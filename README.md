# ICU-VSR (ICU Visual Speech Recognition)

ICU-VSR is a proof-of-concept web application for camera-only visual speech recognition (VSR) designed to support communication in intensive care settings.

The app records a short silent video clip of a patient mouthing words, sends the clip to a backend VSR model, and returns a predicted transcript that can be displayed and spoken aloud.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project explores whether visual speech recognition can assist patients who are unable to speak, such as:

- Tracheostomy/Laryngectomy patients  
- Patients with voice impairment  
- Patients with ICU-acquired weakness

## 📚 Models, Licensing & IP

This project uses third-party open-source visual speech recognition models and research code.

- The backend is based on the Auto-AVSR framework  
- Model weights are derived from LRS3-based visual speech recognition models  
- All underlying models, datasets, and research code remain the intellectual property of their original authors  

Use, redistribution, modification, or deployment must comply with:

- Original project licences  
- Model licensing terms  
- Dataset usage restrictions  
- Institutional governance and ethics requirements

- Hugging Face Spaces (Docker)
- FastAPI + Uvicorn
- Auto-AVSR pipeline
- MediaPipe (face/lip tracking)
- LRS3 trained visual speech recognition model

The backend currently runs on CPU, so inference time depends on model load, clip length, and Space availability.
